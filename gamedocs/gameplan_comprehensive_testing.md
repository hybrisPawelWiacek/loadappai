# LoadApp.AI Services and Endpoints Documentation

## Test Plan Overview

### Test Coverage Targets
- Critical Components (Core Infrastructure, Domain Model): 90%+ coverage
- Business Logic (Domain Services): 85%+ coverage
- Infrastructure Components: 80%+ coverage
- API Endpoints: 75%+ coverage

### Test Dependencies
Each component should be tested in the following order, as later components depend on earlier ones:

1. Core Infrastructure
2. Domain Model (Value Objects → Entities)
3. Infrastructure (Models → Repositories → External Services)
4. Domain Services
5. API Endpoints
