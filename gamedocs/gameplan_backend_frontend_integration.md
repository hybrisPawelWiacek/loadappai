# Backend-Frontend Integration Gameplan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 21, 2024  
**Status:** Draft  
**Related Documents:**

- API_Specification.md

## Overview

This gameplan outlines the strategy for connecting the frontend application with backend services, ensuring all domain capabilities are properly exposed and utilized. The plan addresses the current gaps between backend services, API exposure, and frontend implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Backend Services & Entities
- Entities and services are implemented and tested
- Core functionality includes route planning, cost calculation, and offer generation
- Services include AI integration for offer enhancement

### API Layer
- Not fully exposing entity and service capabilities
- Missing detailed route segments and cost breakdowns
- Incomplete offer generation features

### Frontend
- Using mocked data instead of API calls
- Simplified data models compared to backend
- Missing several key features from backend services

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Route Planning Flow

#### 1. API Endpoints Enhancement
```python
# 1. Route Planning Endpoints
@app.route('/api/routes', methods=['POST'])
def create_route():
    """Create route with empty driving calculation"""
    # Maps RouteCreateRequest to domain Route
    # Includes empty driving (200km/4h) automatically
    # Returns RouteResponse with segments

@app.route('/api/routes/<route_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_route():
    """Get route details with segments"""
    # Returns full route visualization data
    # Includes country segments for cost calculation
```

Required Changes:
- Update RouteResponse to include empty driving segments
- Add country-specific segment information
- Add timeline events (pickup, delivery)

#### 2. Frontend Component Updates
```python
# src/frontend/components/route_form.py
class RouteFormData:
    """Update to match backend API"""
    origin: Location  # Use backend Location model
    destination: Location
    pickup_time: datetime
    delivery_time: datetime
    transport_type: str
    
# src/frontend/components/map_visualization.py
class RouteSegment:
    """Update to handle backend route data"""
    start_location: Location
    end_location: Location
    distance_km: float
    duration_hours: float
    is_empty_driving: bool
    country: str
    timeline_event: Optional[str]  # pickup/delivery/empty
```

### Phase 2: Cost Calculation Integration

#### 1. API Endpoints Enhancement
```python
# 1. Cost Calculation Endpoints
@app.route('/api/routes/<route_id>/costs', methods=['GET'])
def calculate_route_cost():
    """Calculate costs for route"""
    # Uses CostCalculationService
    # Returns detailed CostBreakdown

@app.route('/api/settings/costs', methods=['GET', 'PUT'])
def manage_cost_settings():
    """Get/Update cost calculation settings"""
    # Manages fuel prices, toll rates, etc.
```

Required Changes:
- Enhance CostBreakdown to include all components
- Add country-specific cost factors
- Add cargo-specific costs

#### 2. Frontend Component Updates
```python
# src/frontend/components/cost_calculation.py
class CostBreakdown:
    """Update to match backend breakdown"""
    fuel_costs: Dict[str, Decimal]  # Per country
    toll_costs: Dict[str, Decimal]  # Per country
    driver_costs: Decimal
    cargo_costs: Dict[str, Decimal]
    overhead_costs: Dict[str, Decimal]
    total_cost: Decimal
```

### Phase 3: Offer Generation Integration

#### 1. API Endpoints Enhancement
```python
# 1. Offer Generation Endpoints
@app.route('/api/offers', methods=['POST'])
def create_offer():
    """Generate offer with AI enhancement"""
    # Uses OfferGenerationService
    # Includes AI-generated fun fact
    # Returns complete offer

@app.route('/api/offers', methods=['GET'])
def list_offers():
    """List historical offers"""
    # Supports filtering and sorting
```

Required Changes:
- Add AI fun fact generation
- Include complete cost breakdown
- Add offer metadata

#### 2. Frontend Component Updates
```python
# src/frontend/components/offer_generation.py
class TransportOffer:
    """Update to match backend offer"""
    route_details: RouteResponse
    cost_breakdown: CostBreakdown
    margin: Decimal
    final_price: Decimal
    fun_fact: str
    created_at: datetime
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Backend First Approach
1. Update API models to fully expose domain capabilities
2. Add proper error handling and validation
3. Implement logging for debugging
4. Add API documentation

### 2. Frontend Integration
1. Update frontend models to match API
2. Add API client with proper error handling
3. Implement loading states
4. Add retry logic for failed requests

### 3. Testing Strategy
1. API integration tests
2. Frontend-backend integration tests
3. End-to-end flow testing
4. Error scenario testing

## Success Criteria

### 1. Functional Success
- Complete route planning flow works end-to-end
- Cost calculation includes all components
- Offer generation includes AI enhancements
- Historical data is properly stored and retrievable

### 2. Technical Success
- All domain capabilities are exposed via API
- Frontend correctly displays all data
- Error handling and logging work properly
- Performance meets requirements (response times < 2s)

### 3. Code Quality
- Clean and maintainable code
- Proper documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Consistent error handling

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Technical Risks
- API response time for complex routes
  - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize queries
- AI service availability
  - Mitigation: Add fallback content, retry logic

### 2. Integration Risks
- Data format mismatches
  - Mitigation: Thorough API documentation, strong typing
- Error handling gaps
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive error mapping, logging
