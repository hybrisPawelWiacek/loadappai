Below is a proposed **API Specification & Contract Document** for the PoC scope of LoadApp.AI. This document defines the core endpoints, request/response structures, and expected behaviors. It is designed to be used by both human developers and the AI Dev Agent to ensure consistent implementation and integration.

# LoadApp.AI API Specification & Contract Document (PoC)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the RESTful API endpoints for the LoadApp.AI PoC, focusing on route planning, cost calculation, offer generation, and settings management. It serves as the authoritative contract between the frontend (Streamlit UI) and the backend (Flask API).

Key principles for this PoC API:

- **Simplicity**: Focus on essential operations needed for the PoC.
- **Consistency**: Uniform naming conventions, request/response patterns, and use of JSON.
- **Extensibility**: Endpoints and data structures are designed so they can be extended in the future without breaking changes.

**Base URL:**  
For local development: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`

**Authentication:**  
- PoC: No authentication required. In future versions, authentication and role-based permissions may be added.

**Response Format:**  
- All responses in JSON.
- Use standard HTTP status codes:
  - `2xx` for success
  - `4xx` for client errors (bad input, not found)
  - `5xx` for server errors

**Error Handling:**  
- On errors, return JSON with an `"error"` field containing a message and optionally a code:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid input data",
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT"
  }
  ```

## 3. General Conventions

### 3.1 Date/Time Fields

- All date/time fields in ISO 8601 format with UTC time (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).

### 3.2 Currencies

- PoC: Fixed to `"EUR"`. In future versions, currency might be configurable or dynamic.

### 3.3 Pagination and Filtering

- PoC: For listing offers, no pagination is implemented. If needed, a `limit` and `offset` could be added in the future. Similarly, minimal filtering is supported.

### 3.4 Validation Rules

- Coordinates: latitude must be between -90 and 90, longitude between -180 and 180.
- Times: `pickup_time` must be before `delivery_time`.
- Margin: must be >= 0 and <= 1.0 for PoC.
- Negative cost values are invalid.

---

## 4. Versioning & Deprecation

- PoC: Single version (`v1`).
- Future: Introduce `/api/v2` endpoints as needed. Older endpoints will remain functional for a defined deprecation period.

---

## 5. Examples & Curl Commands

**Create a Route:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/routes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "origin": {"address": "Paris, France", "latitude":48.8566,"longitude":2.3522},
        "destination": {"address":"Frankfurt, Germany","latitude":50.1109,"longitude":8.6821},
        "pickup_time":"2024-12-20T08:00:00Z",
        "delivery_time":"2024-12-21T16:00:00Z",
        "transport_type":"flatbed_truck",
        "cargo_id":"cargo_001"
      }'
```

**Get Route Cost:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/routes/<route_id>/cost
```

**Generate an Offer:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/offers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"route_id":"<route_id>", "margin":0.1}'
```

---

## 6. Future Considerations

- Authentication and API keys when multi-user support and security are introduced.
- Pagination, sorting, and filtering for `/offers` and `/routes` lists.
- More granular partial updates for cost settings.
- Comprehensive error code catalog and internationalization of error messages.
